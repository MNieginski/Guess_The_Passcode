### Langueges Used

This game project is made using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### 1. Goal and Functionality

This will be a guessing game of sorts. The player will be prompted with a keypad, and will have 60 seconds to correctly guess a 4-digit passcode. 

### 3. How to Play

The game is farly simple, you hit the "Start Game" button, which starts the timer, and then you can begin guessing!

### 4. Future Features

In the future, i would like to add a feature where, if you guss a digit correct, it stays in 'screen' until you win or the timer goes down, should decrease the difficulty by a substaintial margin
